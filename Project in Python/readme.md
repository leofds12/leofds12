Project made in Python for registering sales for a small commerce, according to the client needs and budget. The objective of this project is to load the articles sold, description and price. The registers are loaded in a local database using SQLite and Peewee ORM. All this process is made using a GUI made in Tkinter. When the main window of the program is closed, an Excel (.xlsx) file is created loading all the registers from the database and displaying garment sold, model, price, day of the week, number of day, month and year. Information about the date of the sale is made automatically. With this file, the client can do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to predict sales, tendences of price, months with more or less sales, etc. The project has been made using MVC design pattern.
